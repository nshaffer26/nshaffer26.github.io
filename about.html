  <h1>About Me:</h1>
	<p>Hi! My name is Nicholas Shaffer, and I was born on January 26,1998. I
     am currently enrolled at the University at Buffalo. As of yet, I
     have not completely decided what I will major in, however, I am
     pretty certain that computer science is the route I want to take.</p>
