Your goal is to get to the end of the
maze. You will be able to see the whole
maze at the beginning of the level for
3 seconds. After this time, the game will
zoom in on your current location. You can
zoom in and out throught the game using

are zoomed in.

To start a game, select a difficulty. There

     times throught the duration of the
     maze. This will be a medium sized maze.
