Instructions:
Your goal is to get to the end of the maze.
You will be able to see the whole maze
at the beginning of the level. To start
moving, hit the space bar to zoom in on
your current location. You can continue to
zoom in and out throughout the game using
the space bar, but you can only move if you
are zoomed in.

To start a game, select a difficulty. There
are 3 difficulties, and their rules are as
follows:
   Easy - Zoom in and out as many times as
     you'd like. This will be the smallest
     maze of the 3 difficulties.
   Medium - You can only zoom out 5 times
     throughout the duration of the
     maze. This will be a medium sized maze.
   Hard - You can only zoom out 3 times.
     Use them wisely! This will be the
     largest maze.
