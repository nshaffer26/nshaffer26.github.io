                    My name is Nicholas Shaffer, and I am currently studying Game Design and Development at RIT. Prior
                    to RIT, I earned a BA in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo in 2020. I enjoy the more
                    technical aspects of game design and have thus far found myself more drawn to the "Development" side
                    of Game Design and Development. I have experience with C#, C++, JavaScript, Java, Unity, and
                    Blender.

                    <h3>Dungeons, Danger, Glory</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this project, I use PixiJS to create a dungeon crawler within JavaScript. I also utilized
                        Howler.js for audio. The goal of the game is to navigate a maze-like dungeon, collecting gems
                        and avoiding monsters along the way, all while trying to get as far as possible. This is a
                        project I completed by myself, and so my role was one of both design and development. One of my
                        biggest challenges with this project was in building the dungeon's maze-like pattern in a way
                        such that all rooms connected. Another challenge would definitely be getting the textures to
                        line up in a logical way. There's still some work that needs to be done with the textures, and
                        so this project is a work in progress.

                    <p>
                        In this project, I made use of an API called Edamam Recipe Search, which can be found <a
                            href="https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api">here</a>. The goal of this
                        project was to make use of an online API to display recipes based on ingredients and other
                        filters entered by the user. These filters include maximum calories per serving, meal type,
                        cuisine type, and any health labels the user wishes to include. This is a project I completed by
                        myself, and so my role was one of both design and development. A major challenge in completing
                        this project was in getting all of the filters to work and return the expected results. I also
                        faced some issues with the way the API handles images; some of the results returned after an API
                        call do not include proper image links, and so I needed to find a way to sort these out and
                        insert a placeholder image in place of the invalid image.

                    <p>
                        In this project, I made use of an API called PokéAPI, which can be found <a
                            href="https://pokeapi.co/">here</a>. I also used jQuery in this project to simplify some of
                        JavaScript's syntax. My goal was to recreate a game that would take place during commercial
                        breaks of the animated Pokémon show. In this game, viewers were asked to guess the name of a
                        Pokémon after being given only its silhouette. This is a project I completed by myself, and so
                        my role was one of both design and development. This project was my first experience with using
                        an API, and so my biggest challenges came from this lack of experience. Once I was able to get
                        all of the information I needed from the API, I only needed to focus on the layout and
                        functionality of the game to make sure everything was displayed in a logical and
                        easy-to-understand way.

                    <p>
                        In this project, I worked with three other teammates to create a game in Unity. The goal of the
                        game is to survive as long as possible while defending Earth from waves of hostile alien ships.
                        Each wave varies in size and contains a mix of three different enemy types, each with its own
                        unique behavior. As part of a team, my role was primarily that of a general programmer, but I
                        also had a hand in designing some of the game's assets in Blender, including the powerups and
                        the mothership model. Specifically, I worked on enemy behavior, the game's powerup system, as
                        well as environmental details such as the game's asteroids. One challenging aspect towards the
                        beginning of this project was the process of working together as a team. As time went on, we
                        improved our teamwork and learned effective communication techniques like task management via
                        GitHub to ensure everyone was always on track.<!-- The wireframe shader we used for our assets can
                        be found <a href="https://github.com/Chaser324/unity-wireframe">here</a>, and may not work on
                        all machines. -->

                    <p>
                        In this project, I worked as part of the development team for the first few levels of
                        ChangelingVR, a VR first-person interactive mystery in which fantasy creatures coexist with
                        humans. You play a dream-walking detective named Aurelia who has the ability to see the thoughts
                        and memories of anyone she touches. My role on this project was primarily that of a gameplay
                        developer and level designer. Specifically, I helped to identify and build modular branches of
                        discrete gameplay interactions, as well as helped to design or redesign areas of each level to
                        improve flow. All work for this project was done using Unreal Engine 4 and Blueprints. Since I
                        had no prior experience with either of these technologies, one of the most challenging aspects
                        of this project was learning to use them for the first time while also in a professional
                        environment.

                        In this project, I worked with 3 other teammates with the goal of creating a casual rogue-lite
                        game in Unity. In the game, you play the role of an up-and-coming pirate captain trying to gain
                        fame, notoriety, and untold treasures by defeating waves of progressively more difficult
                        enemies. Whenever you defeat an enemy, you are rewarded with gold that you can use at the shop
                        to buy better weapons, more crew members, and special treasures that give unique abilities. If
                        you happen to lose a run, you will be rewarded with “legacy” points, which can be used to buy
                        permanent upgrades at the end of a run that will affect all future runs. My main role on the
                        team was that of a developer, but I also had a hand in some of the UI elements. The game
                        features turn-based combat, procedurally generated maps/levels, and a weapon/crew/upgrade
                        system. My largest contribution to the project can be seen in the upgrade system and shop.
                        This project is still in development.
