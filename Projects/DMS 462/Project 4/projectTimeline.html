					11/3/18 - 11/10/18
					This time period was mainly one of testing for our group. We focused on playing other games in an attempt to find inspiration for our own. These games included Catan and Seven Wonders. Additionally, we knew that we wanted a game involving the collection of resources and that it was to be set in space. Along these lines, we researched games and books to help us develop a rough idea of what our game would become.
					<br>
					<br>
					11/13/18 - 11/17/18
					This time period saw our group further develop what would eventually become a fully realized game. We focused on playtesting amongst ourselves here, as well as refining the core mechanics of our game. We went through multiple different scenarios - such as decreasing then increasing the number of starting ships - in an effort to discover what would be the best approach that would lead to a more balanced system. Additionally, we thought about how the mechanics were going to fit within the narrative structure we wanted to establish.
					<br>
					<br>
					11/27/18
					This was an important day for our group, as it was the first time anyone from outside our team got a chance to play and experience the game. It taught us a lot, including but not limited to what aspects of the game worked and why. More importantly, however, it gave us a fresh perspective on what parts of our game needed a bit more attention.
					<br>
					<br>
					11/29/18 - 12/11/18
					This time period was one of the most critical of the whole process. Here, we focused on taking what we learned from our numerous play sessions and tweaking our game accordingly. We wanted to also focus on how the story fit together with the game mechanics. All in all, our efforts as well as the invaluable feedback we received from our playtesters helped us to create a game that we hope is balanced and enjoyable.
