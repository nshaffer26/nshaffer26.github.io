					<b>Game:</b> <i>Catan</i><br>
					<br>
					<b>Designer:</b> Klaus Teuber<br>
					<br>
					<b>Released:</b> 1995<br>
					<br>
					<b>Description:</b><br>
					“Players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)—wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone—to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.”

					<b><ins>Chapter 3:</ins></b><br>
					<b>Invitation to Play:</b><br>
					The game is very simple in its design. Wooden pieces and a number of cards with pictures representing different resources can be found within the game’s box. These simple elements are easy to understand for beginners and thus very inviting to all kinds of players.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Number of players:</b> 3-4<br>
					<br>
					<b>Player roles:</b><br>
					Roles are uniform for all players. Each player has the goal to accumulate 10 victory points. They can, however, accomplish this goal in a number of different ways.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Player Interaction Pattern:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Multilateral</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Objectives:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Main objective to obtain 10 victory points</li>
						<li>This can be done in a few ways, including:
							<ul>
								<li>Players can purchase “Development Cards” which may or may not award them with victory points</li>
								<li>Players can strive to build the longest road, which will get them some more victory points</li>
								<li>Players can also attempt to build as many settlements and cities as they can, each awarding them with more victory points</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Procedures:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Placing board tiles
							<ul>
								<li>This adds a bit of randomness to the game. Although there is a recommended board set up, you can still change it up if you want.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Roll the dice</li>
						<li>Collect resources</li>
						<li>Build roads/settlements/cities</li>
						<li>Move the robber</li>
						<li>Trade (with the bank and with other players)</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Resources:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Wood</li>
						<li>Grain</li>
						<li>Brick</li>
						<li>Sheep</li>
						<li>Stone</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Sources of conflict:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Players can move the robber wherever they want, causing a resource to be blocked until it is moved again</li>
						<li>Players may attempt to “block” other players from accomplishing certain goals. For example, a player may try to prevent another from building the longest road by blocking their path with their own road</li>
						<li>Resources are limited</li>
						<li>A player can, but shouldn’t, have more than 7 cards in their hand, otherwise they risk losing half of their resources</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Boundaries:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Finite resources</li>
						<li>Finite space to build roads/settlements/cities</li>
						<li>Unwritten agreement between players to follow the rules and procedures</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Possible outcomes:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>A player wins the game</li>
						<li>The rest of the players lose</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b><ins>Chapter 4:</ins></b><br>
					<b>Challenges:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Outwitting other players</li>
						<li>Beating chance</li>
						<li>Obtaining enough, but not too many resources</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Nature of Play:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Competitive (Rule-Based)</li>
						<li>Chance-Based (Rule-Based)</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Types of Players:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>The Competitor</li>
						<li>The Collector</li>
						<li>The Achiever</li>
						<li>The Craftsman</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Premise:</b><br>
					Players are settlers trying to establish colonies on the island of Catan. They do this by trying to collect resources and spend them wisely in order to establish the most prosperous settlements.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Characters:</b><br>
					None - Players of the game may make up their own story surrounding the “characters” within their settlements. Beyond this, there are no actual characters in the game
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Story:</b><br>
					There is not really story to the game beyond the premise, which is that you are trying to build the most “prosperous” series of roads, settlements, and cities.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>World Building:</b><br>
					The game designers present you with the fictional island of Catan where you are free to develop it as you see fit. In this sense, players build their own world, or rather expand on the template given to them by the designers.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Dramatic Arc:</b><br>
					Since there is no real story to Catan, there is not necessarily a defined dramatic arc. However, different milestones reached by players within the course of a play session could be considered peaks of the experience presented by the game. As such, when a player wins the game it could be considered the “climax” of the “dramatic arc.”
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>An example of a short term goal & the feedback for that goal:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Players try to gather resources
							<ul>
								<li>A player’s goal could be to collect as many resources of as many types as they can in order to build what they want. Feedback for this goal comes when a player rolls a 7. When this happens, if any player has more than 7 resources in their hand, they must get rid of half of them. This is feedback in that it prevents any one player from gaining too many resources.</li>

					<b>Describe how you might change the elements of the system in order to significantly change the dynamics; what do you believe the new dynamics will be like? Will the game still be playable? Will it still be balanced?</b><br>
					One way in which to change the dynamics of the game system significantly would be to remove the limit placed on the number of cards you can hold. This would also therefore eliminate the rule that if a player rolls a 7, every player with more than 7 cards must get rid of half. This would change the dynamics of the system by effectively making the finite amount of resource cards very scarce. This would happen because players would more than likely hoard resources because there is no repercussion for doing so. This may, as a result, increase trading among players: If one player gets to a point where they have all of a particular type of resource, other players would want to trade with that player to get the resource they need. Although this version of the game would still be playable, it would more than likely be very unbalanced. If one player happens to position his pieces in a way such that he has a monopoly on a particular resource, all other players become dependent on that player to get the resources they need.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Describe the economy within the game (if there is one). Is there a metaeconomy?</b><br>
					There is a simple bartering system in Catan, where players may either trade resources amongst each other, or with the bank. Additionally, there are a fixed amount of resources which have value based on how badly the player needs them (for player to player transactions). For trading with the bank, there is a set ratio for trading that is by default 4 for 1. This ratio can change based on gameplay aspects such as ports. There is no metaeconomy.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Identify the important pieces of information. Which ones are hidden and which are open?</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Open Information
							<ul>
								<li>Layout of other players roads/settlements/cities</li>
								<li>What resources you get from a particular space on the board</li>
								<li>Where the robber is</li>
								<li>How many victory points the other players have</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Hidden Information
							<ul>
								<li>What resources the other players are holding</li>
								<li>What strategy the other players are using</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Describe the methods of control. Are they direct or indirect? Real-time or turn-based?</b><br>
					The game uses an indirect, turn-based control structure. For example, players participate when it is their turn, where they roll the dice. If they roll a 7, then the players resource capacity is indirectly controlled by limiting it to 7 or less. This method of control is indirect because the rules do not state that you cannot have more than 7 cards - you can have as many as you want. You should, however, attempt to limit the number of resources you’re holding else you run the risk of losing half of your resources.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Describe one significant feedback loop. Is it reinforcing or balancing?</b><br>
					One significant feedback loop is, as mentioned, the one where if a player rolls a seven, every player with more than 7 cards must get rid of half of their hand. This would be an example of a balancing feedback loop because it limits the number of resources a player can accumulate at any one time.
