					<b>Game:</b> <i>Catan</i><br>
					<br>
					<b>Designer:</b> Klaus Teuber<br>
					<br>
					<b>Released:</b> 1995<br>
					<br>
					<b>Description:</b><br>
					“Players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)—wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone—to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.”

					<b><ins>Chapter 3:</ins></b><br>
					<b>Invitation to Play:</b><br>
					The game is very simple in its design. Wooden pieces and a number of cards with pictures representing different resources can be found within the game’s box. These simple elements are easy to understand for beginners and thus very inviting to all kinds of players.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Number of players:</b> 3-4<br>
					<br>
					<b>Player roles:</b><br>
					Roles are uniform for all players. Each player has the goal to accumulate 10 victory points. They can, however, accomplish this goal in a number of different ways.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Player Interaction Pattern:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Multilateral</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Objectives:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Main objective to obtain 10 victory points</li>
						<li>This can be done in a few ways, including:
							<ul>
								<li>Players can purchase “Development Cards” which may or may not award them with victory points</li>
								<li>Players can strive to build the longest road, which will get them some more victory points</li>
								<li>Players can also attempt to build as many settlements and cities as they can, each awarding them with more victory points</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Procedures:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Placing board tiles
							<ul>
								<li>This adds a bit of randomness to the game. Although there is a recommended board set up, you can still change it up if you want.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Roll the dice</li>
						<li>Collect resources</li>
						<li>Build roads/settlements/cities</li>
						<li>Move the robber</li>
						<li>Trade (with the bank and with other players)</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Resources:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Wood</li>
						<li>Grain</li>
						<li>Brick</li>
						<li>Sheep</li>
						<li>Stone</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Sources of conflict:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Players can move the robber wherever they want, causing a resource to be blocked until it is moved again</li>
						<li>Players may attempt to “block” other players from accomplishing certain goals. For example, a player may try to prevent another from building the longest road by blocking their path with their own road</li>
						<li>Resources are limited</li>
						<li>A player can, but shouldn’t, have more than 7 cards in their hand, otherwise they risk losing half of their resources</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Boundaries:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Finite resources</li>
						<li>Finite space to build roads/settlements/cities</li>
						<li>Unwritten agreement between players to follow the rules and procedures</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Possible outcomes:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>A player wins the game</li>
						<li>The rest of the players lose</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b><ins>Chapter 4:</ins></b><br>
					<b>Challenges:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Outwitting other players</li>
						<li>Beating chance</li>
						<li>Obtaining enough, but not too many resources</li>
					</ul>

						<li>Competitive (Rule-Based)</li>
						<li>Chance-Based (Rule-Based)</li>

					<b>Premise:</b><br>
					Players are settlers trying to establish colonies on the island of Catan. They do this by trying to collect resources and spend them wisely in order to establish the most prosperous settlements.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Characters:</b><br>
					None - Players of the game may make up their own story surrounding the “characters” within their settlements. Beyond this, there are no actual characters in the game
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Story:</b><br>
					There is not really story to the game beyond the premise, which is that you are trying to build the most “prosperous” series of roads, settlements, and cities.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>World Building:</b><br>
					The game designers present you with the fictional island of Catan where you are free to develop it as you see fit. In this sense, players build their own world, or rather expand on the template given to them by the designers.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Dramatic Arc:</b><br>
					Since there is no real story to Catan, there is not necessarily a defined dramatic arc. However, different milestones reached by players within the course of a play session could be considered peaks of the experience presented by the game. As such, when a player wins the game it could be considered the “climax” of the “dramatic arc.”
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>An example of a short term goal & the feedback for that goal:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Players try to gather resources
							<ul>
								<li>A player’s goal could be to collect as many resources of as many types as they can in order to build what they want. Feedback for this goal comes when a player rolls a 7. When this happens, if any player has more than 7 resources in their hand, they must get rid of half of them. This is feedback in that it prevents any one player from gaining too many resources.</li>

					<b>Describe how you might change the elements of the system in order to significantly change the dynamics; what do you believe the new dynamics will be like? Will the game still be playable? Will it still be balanced?</b><br>
					One way in which to change the dynamics of the game system significantly would be to remove the limit placed on the number of cards you can hold. This would also therefore eliminate the rule that if a player rolls a 7, every player with more than 7 cards must get rid of half. This would change the dynamics of the system by effectively making the finite amount of resource cards very scarce. This would happen because players would more than likely hoard resources because there is no repercussion for doing so. This may, as a result, increase trading among players: If one player gets to a point where they have all of a particular type of resource, other players would want to trade with that player to get the resource they need. Although this version of the game would still be playable, it would more than likely be very unbalanced. If one player happens to position his pieces in a way such that he has a monopoly on a particular resource, all other players become dependent on that player to get the resources they need.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Describe the economy within the game (if there is one). Is there a metaeconomy?</b><br>
					There is a simple bartering system in Catan, where players may either trade resources amongst each other, or with the bank. Additionally, there are a fixed amount of resources which have value based on how badly the player needs them (for player to player transactions). For trading with the bank, there is a set ratio for trading that is by default 4 for 1. This ratio can change based on gameplay aspects such as ports. There is no metaeconomy.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Identify the important pieces of information. Which ones are hidden and which are open?</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Open Information
							<ul>
								<li>Layout of other players roads/settlements/cities</li>
								<li>What resources you get from a particular space on the board</li>
								<li>Where the robber is</li>
								<li>How many victory points the other players have</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Hidden Information
							<ul>
								<li>What resources the other players are holding</li>
								<li>What strategy the other players are using</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Describe the methods of control. Are they direct or indirect? Real-time or turn-based?</b><br>
					The game uses an indirect, turn-based control structure. For example, players participate when it is their turn, where they roll the dice. If they roll a 7, then the players resource capacity is indirectly controlled by limiting it to 7 or less. This method of control is indirect because the rules do not state that you cannot have more than 7 cards - you can have as many as you want. You should, however, attempt to limit the number of resources you’re holding else you run the risk of losing half of your resources.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Describe one significant feedback loop. Is it reinforcing or balancing?</b><br>
					One significant feedback loop is, as mentioned, the one where if a player rolls a seven, every player with more than 7 cards must get rid of half of their hand. This would be an example of a balancing feedback loop because it limits the number of resources a player can accumulate at any one time.

					<b>Game:</b> <i>7 Wonders</i><br>
					<br>
					<b>Designer:</b> Antoine Bauza<br>
					<br>
					<b>Released:</b> 2010<br>
					<br>
					<b>Description:</b><br>
					7 Wonders is a card drafting game featuring ancient civilizations. Players share a limited subset of cards representing structures that they can build in order to help their civilization, and “Wonder” prosper. Different structures facilitate different winning strategies including trade, combat, and resource production.
					<br>

					</ul>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b><ins>Chapter 3:</ins></b><br>
					<b>Invitation to Play:</b><br>
					The box art is very colorful and prominently features well known ancient wonders all within the same city area; the art is appropriate and intriguing. The game’s box also advertises that it’s appropriate for players age 10+ and only takes around 30 minutes, meaning it’s open to a fairly large demographic. The game has received a number of rewards and is lauded for the gameplay it provides.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Number of players:</b> 2-7<br>
					<br>
					<b>Player roles:</b><br>
					Every player has the same basic role. However, each player is in charge of developing one of seven different ancient civilizations and its respective “wonder”, each of which offers slightly different rewards for completing building tasks and may inform the player’s strategy.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Player Interaction Pattern:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Multilateral</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Objectives:</b>
					The main objective is to be the player with the most “victory points” at the end of the game. Victory points are earned from building basic structures, building your “wonder”, battling others, and strategically developing your civilization to maximize the benefits of certain structure cards. This offers players numerous paths to achieve the same basic goal.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Procedures:</b>
					There are three separate “ages”. During each age, each player starts with 7 randomly dealt cards. Each turn, they can use the resources they currently have or trade with others with construct the building on a single card in their hand. If they choose not to build or cannot build because they do not have the necessary resources, they may instead discard a card for currency. The types of structures available to build, their cost, and the benefits they offer the player vary depending on the age. After choosing a card, players pass their hand to the player next to them (CW or CCW depending on the age), and repeat the process until one card is left. The last card is discarded. At the end of each age, players may earn positive or negative “conflict tokens” from battle if anyone has built military structures. At the end of the third age, victory points are computed for all players based on their conflict tokens and structures they have built, and the player with the most wins.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Resources:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Clay</li>
						<li>Ore</li>
						<li>Stone</li>
						<li>Wood</li>
						<li>Glass</li>
						<li>Loom</li>
						<li>Papyrus</li>
						<li>Coins</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Sources of conflict:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Players may choose to build military structures during the course of the game. If a neighboring player’s military outpowers your own, they gain victory tokens (effectively victory points) while you lose them. The amount of points gained increases as the age increases, incentivizing players to keep track of their military prowess as they develop their civilization.</li>
						<li>Additionally, since the pool of cards is shared, each player is able to directly influence the cards the player next to them will have in their next turn. This means that players not only have to think about building what is beneficial to them, but also what they may not want their opponent to have.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Boundaries:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Each player has their own personal board / building area to construct their civilization.</li>
						<li>Unwritten agreement to follow the rules and procedures of the game.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Possible outcomes:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>A single player has the most victory points and wins</li>
						<li>Two or more players tie victory points and the player with the most coins wins</li>
						<li>Two or more players tie in victory points and coins and both win (very unlikely)</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b><ins>Chapter 4:</ins></b><br>
					<b>Challenges:</b>
					Dynamically changing your strategy to adapt to the structures your opponents choose to build while developing your own civilization; overcoming slight randomness of the cards drawn; resource management.
					<br>

					<b>Nature of Play:</b>
					<ul>

					<b>Premise:</b><br>
					Players are developing one of seven cities in the ancient world. They produce resources, build structures, trade, and battle with each other to become the most prominent civilization.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Characters:</b><br>
					There are no characters, players act as the representative/ruler of one of seven ancient civilizations
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Story:</b><br>
					Although the premise and locations are based on history, there is not much story outside of the premise. Players won’t experience story during the game, but may choose to portray one based on the cards they play.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>World Building:</b><br>
					Players are tasked with the development of one of the seven ancient civilizations: Gizah, Olympia, Bablyon, Alexandria, Ephesos, Halikarnassos, or Rhodos. As players build the different types of structures -- civilian, military, treasury, commercial, guilds, or the “wonder” -- different resources, actions and strategies become available to them and can influence subsequent building choices. Although players can build their city in any way they choose, there are many cards that play off each other thematically and the game mechanics reinforce this notion by making it more lucrative to build structures that relate.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Dramatic Arc:</b><br>
					The game occurs over three separate ages, effectively rounds. Though there is no real story throughout the game, each age provides different types of structures to build: the structures become more expensive but also more powerful and interesting. This provides a sense of development over time.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>An example of a short term goal & the feedback for that goal:</b>
					Players may choose to make their army the strongest by building up the most military structures. As they build the structure, they place it on the “board” for all to see. At the end of an age, they will be rewarded positive conflict tokens (+1 to +5, depending on the age) for each neighboring player they overpowered, while the player(s) they defeated will receive a negative conflict token (-1).

					<b>Describe how you might change the elements of the system in order to significantly change the dynamics; what do you believe the new dynamics will be like? Will the game still be playable? Will it still be balanced?</b><br>
					It would be possible to significantly change the game dynamics by changing how players are able to use and acquire resources. Currently, once a player has a structure that produces a resource, they have access to that resource for future construction every single turn. If players instead drew cards or tokens and were able to accumulate and expend resources to build, it would become necessary to think about potentially keeping certain resources on-hand for future turns. As is, players would likely end up with an overabundance of resources since the build cost and trade system is not designed with this in mind; however, if the costs were increased slightly or there was a limiting factor on how many resources a player could hold at once, it would add a significant layer of complexity to resource management.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Describe the economy within the game (if there is one). Is there a metaeconomy?</b><br>
					The economy centers around construction resources. Resources are used to build structure cards that produce more or different resources for use each turn. Resources may be traded (shared) with neighboring players if they pay for their use. This encourages players to build structures that generate different types of resources, especially ones their neighbors may need.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Identify the important pieces of information. Which ones are hidden and which are open?</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Open Information
							<ul>
								<li>The civilization/wonder each person has and what it produces and provides for developing it.</li>
								<li>Similarly, the structures that others have built, what benefits they provide (resources, battle, trade price reductions, victory points).</li>
								<li>The coins each player has.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Hidden Information
							<ul>
								<li>The cards you may choose from to build each round. At the start of an age, this information is hidden from others. However, since cards are passed between players after building, it’s possible to loosely keep track of what cards a player may end up with when the deck you have gets to them. This is especially important if there are fewer than seven players and you have the chance of seeing the same cards twice.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Describe the methods of control. Are they direct or indirect? Real-time or turn-based?</b><br>
					7 Wonders follows a turn-based indirect control model. Each turn, every player has the opportunity to build a structure which slightly alters the dynamics of the game and the options available to each player. Although players are in control of what they build and are able to enact their own playstyle throughout the game, the decisions available to them are heavily influenced by what others may decide to do and the current state of the game board.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Describe one significant feedback loop. Is it reinforcing or balancing?</b><br>
					As previously mentioned, certain structure cards relate to each other thematically. These cards have special “build chain” properties where if you have built the previous structure, you are able to build the next one at no cost. The chained structures offer even greater benefits, and you don’t lose the benefits of the original structure. This is a reinforcing loop.

					<b>Game:</b> <i>Chinese Checkers</i><br>
					<br>
					<b>Designer:</b> Unknown - Germany<br>
					<br>
					<b>Released:</b> 1893<br>
					<br>
					<b>Description:</b><br>
					Chinese Checkers, or Stern-Halma, is a version of Halma supporting up to six players. Parenthetically, it is neither Chinese nor is it Checkers. In many countries, it's known as Chinese Chess or China-Chess which is even less accurate and definitely shouldn't be confused with Xiangqi which is the true Chess variant from China.

					<b><ins>Chapter 3:</ins></b><br>
					<b>Invitation to Play:</b><br>
					The invitation comes from the more complex version of checkers. There are multiple layers and color which can pique the interest of outside players and due to the shape of the board it can accommodate these players as well.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Number of players:</b> 2-4, 6<br>
					<br>
					<b>Player roles:</b><br>
					Players jump over their own and/or their opponents' pieces with the objective of being the first to move all their pieces from one side to the opposing side.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Player Interaction Pattern:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Player vs. Player</li>
						<li>Multilateral</li>
						<li>Team Competition</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Objectives:</b>
					Prevent players from moving their pieces to the other side. Move all of your pieces to the other side first. Outwit
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Procedures:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Players choose a color and place the 10 pegs into the appropriately colored triangle</li>
						<li>Toss a coin to see who goes first</li>
						<li>Players take turns moving a single peg of their own color
							<ul>
								<li>Pegs can move to an adjacent OR may hop another peg into a vacant hole directly beyond it</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Resources:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>10 colored pegs</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Sources of conflict:</b>
					Peg can be left in their original triangle to prevent the opponent from filling the triangle. Players also can use each other to hop faster and farther across the board, so conflict will arise during the gameplay.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Boundaries:</b>
					Limited spaces to move pegs. Game board creates the boundary for gameplay.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Possible outcomes:</b>
					Zero-sum game. Winner and Loser
					<br>
					<br>

					<b><ins>Chapter 4:</ins></b><br>
					<b>Challenges:</b>
					Csikszentmihalyi flow diagram for Chinese Checkers seems to be directly correlated with the players. If a player is too skilled playing someone who is a beginner then the game will not be enjoyable for either player. The skilled player will be bored and the beginner with be frustrated. However, changing the amount of players within the system could really change the dynamic of the game.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Nature of Play:</b>
					Chinese Checkers is a competitive play and rule-based game. Players compete with each other to reach all of the pegs to the other side first, and there is a set rule system for completing that objective.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Types of Players:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>The Competitor - to simply win the game</li>
						<li>The Joker - to prevent other players from winning in some way</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Premise:</b><br>
					There is no premise for the game.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Characters:</b><br>
					There are no characters in the game...unless you are a storyteller and you give the pegs their own characteristics. Then you are free to define the premise and story as you see fit.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Story:</b><br>
					No story unless determined by the player.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>World Building:</b><br>
					There is no world to build.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Dramatic Arc:</b><br>
					Speculating the rising action could start after the first move, or the first time a player hops over another. More conflict could occur when one of the players reaches the other side with their first peg, or when they only have one peg left. This narrative allows for constant change in tension during gameplay.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>An example of a short term goal & the feedback for that goal:</b><br>
					Reach your first peg to the opposite end. You could have only moved that piece and then have to deal with moving the rest. The opponent might also change their strategy at this point, so you’ll have to rethink yours.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Which type or types of play does the game feature, according to the categories defined by Roger Caillois:</b><br>
					The game is a competitive play/rule-based play.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>What types of players does the game appeal to / support:</b><br>
					Competitive players
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>What form of narrative storytelling does the game use:</b><br>
					None
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Is there a world built around the game:</b><br>
					No
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>What events in playing the game constitute the peaks of the emotional arc:</b><br>
					One of the players only has a single piece to move to the opposite side.

					<b>Describe how you might change the elements of the system in order to significantly change the dynamics; what do you believe the new dynamics will be like? Will the game still be playable? Will it still be balanced?</b><br>
					One way to change the system is to add a second level of the board where opponents can hop up. This adds a third dimensions which completely changes the gameplay. Maybe you can avoid the opponent all together if each players sicks to a different level. The game will still be playable, however with more spaces it might make it harder for the players to interact with one another. This might also slow down the gameplay since they can’t hop around the board as fast. The game will still be balanced since the change won’t favor any payer. It might just add another layer of strategy to the game.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Describe the economy within the game (if there is one). Is there a metaeconomy?</b><br>
					There is no economy or metaeconomy.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Identify the important pieces of information. Which ones are hidden and which are open?</b><br>
					The important information is the location of the opponents and your own piece. You would need to build a strategy to hop you pieces and move then across the board in the most efficient way possible. Since the game board in open, there is no hidden information.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Describe the methods of control. Are they direct or indirect? Real-time or turn-based?</b><br>
					Direct control in a turn-based manner.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Describe one significant feedback loop. Is it reinforcing or balancing?</b><br>
					You can make a path to hop your pegs across the board, however that opens those spaces up for the opponent to also hop. This is a balancing feedback loop.

					<b><ins>Chapter 3:</ins></b><br>
					<b>Invitation to Play:</b><br>
					Starcraft the video game has an arcade and campaign mode and its expansions have a  co-op and multiplayer mode.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Number of players:</b> 2 to 6 players. Best 4 players<br>
					<br>
					<b>Player roles:</b><br>
					Players take control of the three distinctive races featured in the video games, the Terrans, the Protoss, or the Zerg, to engage in battle across multiple worlds in order to achieve victory.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Player Interaction Pattern:</b>
					Each player controls a faction out of six, that belongs to one race out of three - Humans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each faction has a unique special victory condition, but all factions can also win through victory points that are gained by controlling special areas on some of the planets. Players build units and base upgrades with the resources they gather from the planetary areas that they control, and gain access to additional unit types through those upgrades.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Objectives:</b>
					Each of the six factions can achieve victory by being the first to accomplish one of the following victory conditions: a) accumulate 15 conquest points, b) fulfill its unique special victory objective, or c) eliminate every other faction from play. If no faction has accomplished one these goals by the end of the game, the faction with the most conquest points wins.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Procedures:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Each turn consists of three phases: the Planning Phase, the Execution Phase, and the Regrouping Phase. In the Planning Phase, players take turns placing four of their Order tokens face-down on any planet where they have forces present (note, since the Orders are placed this way, the Orders placed latest are resolved first); these tokens are resolved in the Execution Phase. Game adjustments, including scoring, occur in the Regrouping Phase. There are three types of Orders that utilize resources:
							<ul>
								<li>The Build Order allows Resources to be spent on the purchase of workers (which gather Resources), transports (which allow movement of troops between planets), buildings (increasing the variety of units that may be purchased by the players), modules (upgrades for bases), bases (for  units to deploy), and units. Units are generally associated with the building that they are trained in the video game (or, for Zerg players, the building that allows them to be spawned in the video game).</li>
								<li>The Research Order allows players to spend Resources to add Technology Cards to their Combat Card Deck.</li>
								<li>The Mobilise Order allows troops to be moved to the planet where the Order was issued. Troops may be moved from other regions on the same planet, or from adjacent planets.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Resources:</b>
					For every planetary area that provides gas or minerals, there is a corresponding Resource card. When a player harvests a resource from one of his areas, he must place one of his available worker tokens on that area’s Resource card, indicating that one unit of that resource has been gathered this game turn. Should an area become “partially depleted” (due to force mining or for any other reason), a player must turn the corresponding Resource card from its normal side to its “partially depleted” side. Should an area become depleted, the resource card is removed from the game and placed back in the game box. (Such an area can no longer provide resources).
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Sources of conflict:</b>
					Starcraft the board game has too many units, and too many abilities, learning 30+ units appearance and abilities, if they can attack , land or transport becomes difficult to keep track of. There is no simplified version of this game, learning strategies take a couple of turns playing the board game to understand and execute.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Boundaries:</b>
					Players are bound by physical space they play in, as in the board game requires players to be in the same space in order to be able to play it, unlike video games particularly multiplayers games. The board game also restricts or forms the boundary of the game.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Possible outcomes:</b>
					Three possible outcomes of a skirmish are: a) both players must destroy a unit, b) neither player destroys a unit, or c) one player must destroy a unit. The team with the most total conquest points (the sum of the conquest points from both players on the team) is the winner.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b><ins>Chapter 4:</ins></b><br>
					<b>Challenges:</b>
					Initial setup and understanding the strategies and rules of the game play becomes challenging, in order to get in the flow of playing and enjoying this game a player needs to play this game a couple of times.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Nature of Play:</b>
					Competitive gameplay, players compete with each other to obtain the most conquest points, Team based play, If either member of a team achieves its special victory objective, the players win as a team. When discussing strategy, teammates may want decide which one of their special victory objectives they want to focus on and put all of their resources into achieving it.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Types of Players:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Depends on the strategy the player adopts to win.
							<ul>
								<li>The Craftsman: Wants to build, craft, engineer, or puzzle things out.</li>
								<li>The Competitor: Plays to best other players, regardless of the game.</li>
								<li>The Explorer: Curious about the world, loves to go adventuring; seeks outside boundaries — physical or mental.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<b>Premise:</b><br>
					Players battle for galactic domination on a dynamic board of interconnected planets. Planetary setup is already part of the game - every player gets two planets to place, and will place their starting base on one of them. Planets are connected with direct and "Z-Axis" connections that are placed during setup, but can sometimes later be modified during the game, and movement is only possible within planets and through those connections (by means of purpose-built transports).
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Characters:</b><br>
					Three races: the versatile Terrans, the mysterious Protoss, and the voracious Zerg. This box contains two factions (in different colors) for each of these races (for a total of six player factions). The factions (named for their leaders), their races, and their faction colors are as follows:

					<b>Story:</b><br>
					The series, set in the beginning of the 26th century, centers on a galactic struggle for dominance among four species—the adaptable and mobile Terrans, the ever-evolving insectoid Zerg, the powerfully enigmatic Protoss, and the "god-like" Xel'Naga creator race—in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy known as the Koprulu Sector.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>World Building:</b><br>
					Starcraft the board game is based off of the video game. It has its own world , maps, history and cultural studies of the inhabitants: Terran, Zerg, and Protoss
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Dramatic Arc:</b><br>
					Depends on the strategy the player chooses to take as well as the players strategy, choices affect the story arc and outcome of the game.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>An example of a short term goal & the feedback for that goal:</b>
					If the player has chosen a special victory condition to win, evaluate what the best) path to that special victory condition could be – which planets have many of the areas you want to be going for, or which planets that have what you need are furthest away from what you think will be the main fight areas between other factions. As you conquer planets  and maneuver around the player himself and other players are aware of the planets you have gone to. Because its a board game it becomes easier to keep track of players moves and strategies to a certain extent.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Which type or types of play does the game feature, according to the categories defined by Roger Caillois:</b><br>
					Starcraft is clearly a competitive strategy, rule-based play, while role-playing games involve both copying  and competition in a rule-based environment.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>What types of players does the game appeal to / support:</b><br>
					Competitive player mainly.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>If the game includes characters, choose one that is controlled by the player. Is the character defined by the game or by the player? Is the character also controlled by any sort of AI? Is the character static or dynamic? Why?</b><br>
					The character is defined by the game. There is no AI, its a board game. Players are dynamic, there strategies and choices they make differ and hence affect the gameplay differently.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>What form of narrative storytelling does the game use:</b><br>
					Branching narrative because there are different strategies a player can choose to adopt and they game can have 3 possible outcomes instead of one.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Is there a world built around the game:</b><br>
					Yes, starcraft is based  in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy known as the Koprulu Sector. It has its own universe , maps, history and cultural studies of the inhabitants: Terran, Zerg, and Protoss. Expansion packs are used to expand the universe, narrative and gameplay choices as well as strategies.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>What events in playing the game constitute the peaks of the emotional arc:</b><br>
					The way the players interact with each other either by fighting  and threatening and acting through game mechanics means, but also and in particular will you act through and with diplomacy, negotiation, generally ingame politics. This is what affects the emotional arc of the game.

								Achieving victory in SCBG is as much about resource management as it is about combat. To properly decimate their foes, players must strengthen their forces by building new units and upgrading their bases. Players must also strengthen their economies by building more workers, increase their mobility by building transports, and gain a technological edge over their opponents by purchasing Technology cards. Players accomplish these things by executing Build and Research orders.

							<td>Combat Cards</td>
							<td>
								Fighting in StarCraft is mainly about combat cards. This makes the combats calculable, but you need to have the right card on your hand.

					<b>Describe how you might change the elements of the system in order to significantly change the dynamics; what do you believe the new dynamics will be like? Will the game still be playable? Will it still be balanced?</b><br>
					Changing the elements of this game would be difficult only because every element affects the other so it becomes difficult to change the variables and imagine what could and would work.  Restricting the number of units and their abilities might make the game easier to keep track of.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Describe the economy within the game (if there is one). Is there a metaeconomy?</b><br>
					Metaecnomony doesnt exist in this game since its a board game, however buying expansion packs and decks could be traded in the real world.  Starcrafts video game or online game, allows players to trade and purchase online.
					<br>

					<b>Describe one significant feedback loop. Is it reinforcing or balancing?</b><br>
					Game contains both reinforcing and balancing feedback loop. Depends on the particular game mechanic or rule, for example by upgrading you can mine for more resources and upgrade your technology, opportunity for all the players Reinforcing because of the conquest points a players can keep track of where they stand in the game.
