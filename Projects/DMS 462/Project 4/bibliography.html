					The book, Space Time Play: Computer games architecture and urbanism: the next level, searches for the cultural context of video games by organizing and collecting a collection of projects and essays that discuss the relationship of games, urban design, and architecture. The book aims to explore and understand how people interact with new digital spaces as well and indicates the potential direction for these spaces in the future. Video games, digital or manual both through their game mechanics and strategies help understand and resolve real world issues to a certain extent. Questions within the discussion in this book that lead to many different interpretations to the use of architecture in video games, and vice versa. The research includes essays in this book that serve as a starting point for study and research between architecture and video games. The collection of games mentioned in this book allow for us to critically think about game design and its mechanics as well it’s real world implications.

					Discusses the ins and outs of video game design and development. This book gives tips for brainstorming and playtesting ideas, as well as tips to help make the games you design enjoyable and interesting. The ideas discussed in this book were used to analyze our game from a critical perspective, as well as to help us to develop questions for our playtesters.

					Anna Anthropy’s book Rise of the Videogame Zinesters: how Freaks, Normals, Amateurs, Artists, Dreamers, Dropouts, Queers, Housewives, and People like You are taking back an Art Form, where she promotes the idea of the DIY game that anybody can make, and compares them to the photocopied underground zine . Anthropy represents a hybrid position in that her games demonstrate considerable technical skill in referencing and combining elements from video game history, while she is also arguing for a type of development that is less reliant on such skills. She describes how her own venture into game development began with a $15 license for Game Maker, a popular program that allows users to rapidly prototype and publish games without knowing how to write code. She wants the industry to move beyond the corporate systems of production and misogynistic culture and to support games that represent a wider variety of human experiences. The book is a guide to game design encourages upcoming designers to bring their unique backgrounds and experiences to their creations and widen the playing field of an industry that has for too long catered to an adolescent male consumer base. She gives suggestions on what tools (code or text based) to use depending on the type of game.
