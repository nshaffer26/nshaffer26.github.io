                    While avoiding monsters, the player must make their way through a maze-like dungeon to find gems and
                    other riches! Find bombs along the way to defend yourself and last as long as possible!

            <h2>Details:</h2>
            <h3>Genre</h3>
            <p>Rouge-Like Dungeon Crawler, Action, Adventure</p>

            <h3>Platform</h3>
            <p>Desktop</p>

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>The player must make their way through a procedurally generated, maze-like dungeon while avoiding
                monsters.
                Survive for as long as possible and collect as many gems as you can!</p>

            <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
            <p>I'm aiming for a more retro look. Dungeons will be a semi-randomly laid out grid, and the player
                character,
                monsters, and enemies will hopefully be pixel-art style sprites. Sounds will be 8-bit with ambient
                background music. The background music might change depending on the which level the player is in.</p>

            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>The gameplay will be mostly self-explanatory. The player will be told basic controls, such as moving and
                attacking. I plan on having crates scattered around that could contain either bombs or gems. The player
                can
                choose to attack with a melee attack or throw a bomb. Bombs will be more effective in attacking
                monsters.
                The player will be told how to move, attack, and how to switch attack modes (between melee and bombs).

            <h3>Other</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, the only external library I plan to use is PixiJS. Assets will most likely be sourced from
                online, open-source resources.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Nicholas Shaffer, and I am currently in my first year of studying Game Design and Development
                at
                RIT. Prior to RIT, I earned a BA in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo in 2020. I enjoy the
                more technical aspects of game design and have thus far found myself more drawn to the "Development"
                side of
                Game Design and Development. I have experience with C#, C++, JavaScript, and Java, as well as both Unity
                and
                Blender.

            <h2>Documentation</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>The goal of this project was to create a game from scratch using PixiJS. The game I created for this
                project
                is a dungeon crawler in which you must collect gems and avoid enemies while making your way through a
                maze-like dungeon. As you progress from level to level, more enemies will spawn, and the maze will
                become
                bigger.</p>

            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>My design process was to focus on the functionality first and aesthetics second. I first turned my
                attention
                towards generating rooms that would connect in a maze-like pattern. After I figured that out, I focused
                on
                getting the different elements spawned into each room of the dungeon. These elements include crates,
                exits,
                and enemies. Next, I focused on creating rooms that were more varied, and then on enemies that could
                move
                throughout these rooms. Once I finished this, I focused my attention on the GUI and the collisions that
                would affect the values displayed, such as health, number of gems, and level. One of the last things I
                did
                before turning my attention towards implementing sprites for my objects was giving the player the
                ability to
                attack crates and enemies. Once I figured this out, I spent some time creating a couple of my own
                sprites,
                as well as finding others that I was unable to create myself. My final task was to add music and sound
                effects to my game.</p>

            <h3>TODO</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I wasn't quite able to get my textures mapped properly to the dungeon, I would like to fix this in
                    the
                    future.</li>
                <li>I would also like to implement some functionality to have the player be able to through some sort of
                    projectile. My initial plan was to give the player bombs, but I was also unable to implement this
                    feature.</li>
                <li>I would like to implement a feature where enemies begin to track the player and chase them if they
                    get
                    too close.</li>
                <li>I would also like to add some variation to the levels. One of my original plans for this project was
                    to
                    have some levels that were in the dark, giving the player a smaller field of view with which to
                    navigate
                    and see enemies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm not too proud of where this current version of my project is aesthetically, but the
                    functionality is
                    all there. I definitely plan to improve upon it once my submission has been graded.</li>
